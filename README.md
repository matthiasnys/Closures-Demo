# Closures-Demo
Small project that does some implementations on Closures. Just very basic, more as a reference on how to do it in Swift.

The project has 2 viewcontrollers and just shows how to create a closure action from a UIButton (exposing it on the ViewController).
Coded as a tutorial project for a coworker.

## Running

Just open the project and hit "CMD+R"

## Playground

This show an other type of closure use. How to use it as "functional" type.
